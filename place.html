	<p>My Character originates from the plant kravchenko, a pinkish blue plant with huge star so huge you could see it from plants away.
	The huge star is special because it holds special space crafts, special to plant kravchenko. These special space ships are called boltz.
	Boltz can travel from plant to plant in the matter of milliseconds, needless to say you dont need any other space craft. The huge star that is on the plant is
	like a huge recharging station for the small Botlzcrafts, the people from kravchenko have developed these boltz crafts  from star dust found inside the huge star
    making it the first space craft to use star dust to power it up, making it more enviromently friendly</p>
