Semester/Year:
Software:

Description (200 words  giving the person listening to your work insight into your creative and technical process. For example: What was the artistic inspiration for this project? How did you make it your own? What format did you choose to make it in (music video, animation short, pseudo documentary)? What is your video about? What media techniques did you use? How did it change from your Storyboard conception to finish?
<br>

My inspiration is anime theme intros like Naruto, or dragon ball z. Iâ€™ve decided that i wanted to make a 30 second video of showing the world and the stars around the world but i tried so hard to draw everything like imagined. The format I choose to make it a animation short of a intro to Estrellamans life. The video is about the Estrella man and his beginnings it shows how as he arrives to his plant and protects it from the top of the world. Then it cuts to show his intro artwork saying the adventures of Estrella man, and his face in the middle. The media techniques was adobe illustrator, Photoshop, Aftereffect, and media encoder it started with illustrator drawing out my characters logo I was drawing everything out, then i moved to photoshop and made frame by frame drawings of Estrella mans intro, from then on i went to after effects and added music and slowed some parts and tried to use rotor scope for my characters logo.
