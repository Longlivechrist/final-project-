	<h1> Abaility's </h1>
	<p>My Characters unusual transformation is going berserk, when he canâ€™t control his emotions he goes insane and he gets super intensely powerful and goes on a rampage, which Is something he tries to fix because his rage has destroyed so many cities and he has felt bad for that. He gets super huge and his eyes turn into huge stars with electricity soaring so high up in the sky. Also turns all yellow when he transforms into berserk mode.
